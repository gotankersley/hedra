<h1>Rules:</h1>
<div id="rules" style="margin-left:20px;">
	<h3>Objective</h3>
	<p>Each player tries to form a path connecting their home base(s), before the other players in order to win.
	A player may also win by removing all of their opponents' pieces. </p>

	<h3>Paths</h3>
	<p>A path is formed by crossing over an octagonal tile.  No path is formed when just moving from adjacent quad to another.</p>

	<h3>Jumping</h3>
	<p>Opponent pieces may be removed by 'jumping' over them in a manner similar to jumping in Checkers.
</div>

<h1>Optional Rules:</h1>
<div id="optional">
	<table border="1" style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<td>Hex Path (Spheres)</td>
		<td>Allow hexagons to be used as part of the path - 
		however, instead of the usual way of creating a path, (which doesn't work due to the shape of hexagons).
		The hex is added to the path by having at least 2 pieces on adjacent quads</td>
	</tr>
		
	<tr>
		<td>Minor Radius Win (Torus)</td>
		<td>An additional way for players to win by connecting a path around the minor radius of the torus instead of to the other home base</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Wormholes</td>
		<td>These allow transport from one wormhole to another by crossing over the wormhole like creating a path.<br/>  Notes:
		<ol>
			<li>It can be blocked on the sending side if the tile being crossed is not empty.</li>
			<li>If the destination is not empty, then it will remove any pieces on the destination, regardless of side.</li>			
		</ol>
		</td>
